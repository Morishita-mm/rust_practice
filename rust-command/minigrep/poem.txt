The world awakes with colors bright,
A symphony of morning light.
The gentle breeze, a whispered song,
Where fleeting dreams and hopes belong.

Green leaves unfurl, a verdant lace,
Each dewdrop holds a tiny space
For sun's first kiss, a golden gleam,
Reflecting life, a tranquil stream.

The distant mountains, hushed and tall,
Hear ancient echoes rise and fall.
A winding path, a dusty trail,
Where silent stories softly sail.

The sky above, an endless blue,
Holds secrets old, and wonders new.
And in this moment, still and deep,
The soul finds solace, promises to keep.

A silent breath, a peaceful sigh,
As fleeting moments gently fly.
Embrace the calm, the present grace,
A timeless truth in time and space.
