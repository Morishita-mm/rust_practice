The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Don't worry, spiders,
I keep house
casually.
The bustle in a house
The morning after death
Is solemnest of industries
Enacted upon earth,—

The sweeping up the heart,
And putting love away
We shall not want to use again
Until eternity.
Sunrise on the mountaintop is a truly exceptional experience. The cold air fills the lungs, and a sea of clouds stretches out below. You are struck by the illusion that you are the only one in the world within this magnificent silence.



After a while, the eastern horizon begins to glow with a gentle orange hue. This is the moment that touches the heart the most.


And finally, the sun appears. It is the powerful birth of life, the signal that a new day has begun. You feel the energy surging through your entire body.
